# golang.org gotour, annotated

Some of the golang.org tour code examples, but annotated and modified to fit my learning needs.

These are some of the exercises in the [golang tour](https://tour.golang.org/), modified to 
make them more understandable for my personal use and learning needs.


# packages & branches

There is only 1 package, created by following the tutorial on packages. Then all the
modifications are done in the `hello.go` file. The branches in this repository have names
according to the tutorial exercises.


# license

Regarding the license, in case you want to modify and distribute these exercises, you have to made
sure that you follow the golang.org tour license, which may be more restrictive than mine. I
have chosen the GPL v2 to make sure that any golang license requirement is followed. I have no
expectations regarding the use of my modifications (which actually don't have much value). I just
want to ensure I am not sued for distributing the golang.org intellectual property (the original
examples) in an illegal manner.
